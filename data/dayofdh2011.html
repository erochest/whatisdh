<p>In SpecLab (2009), Johanna Drucker explains that the digital humanities does not simply entail “the creation of new electronic environments for access to traditional or born-digital materials. It is the study of ways of thinking differently about how we know what we know, and how the interpretive task of the humanist is redefined in these changed conditions” (xii). What resonates with me about Drucker’s definition is how she conceives of DH both in terms of its epistemological function, and in terms of its function for us as critics—and I will add to her definition, as teachers as well.

<p>Digital Humanities is in its simplest form conducting humanities research with the help of a computer whether it is visualizations or text analysis.  Digital Humanities can also include combining our expertise of computing and programming with the humanities to complete web based projects or other projects that require some programming knowledge.

<p>DH stands for a wide variety of disparate practices, methodologies, and ways of communicating that take advantage of technology in order to enable and encourage the act of thinking deeply and critically about life.  From this perspective, DH is the name given to the work of the most open-minded and courageous humanists working today.
-<i>Stewart Varner, Emory University, USA</i>
</p>
<hr />
<p>I think of digital humanities as an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of digital work in the humanities: development of multimedia pedagogies and scholarship, designing &amp; building tools, human computer interaction, designing &amp; building archives, etc. DH is interdisciplinary; by necessity it breaks down boundaries between disciplines at the local (e.g., English and history) and global (e.g., humanities and computer sciences) levels. 
-<i>Kathie Gossett, Old Dominion Univ, USA</i>
</p>
<hr />
<p>I see 'Digital Humanities' as an umbrella term for two different but related developments:1) Humanities Computing (the specialist use of computing technology to undertake Humanities research) and 2) the implications for the Humanities of the social revolution created by ubiquitous computing and online access. Since the late Noughties the latter seems to have become the driving force in DH with responsibility for much of the 'boom' in public interest and funding.

<p>Digital humanities is a constantly evolving discipline based on scholarship and pedagogy derived from the intersection of computing and technology with traditional humanities education and field of study.

<p>A name that marks a moment of transition; the current name for humanities inquiry driven by or dependent on computers or digitally born objects of study; a temporary epithet for what will eventually be called merely Humanities.

<hr />
<p>One of those moments where the rest of the world and Humanities collide.  Digital Humanities is an opportunity for the Humanities to explore the immense possibilities that the technologies of today can support (and I tentatively suggest, improve) the way in which identification, collection, interpretation, and dissemination of data happens in our field.  
-<i>Nicole Smith, University of Southampton, GB</i>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Digital Humanities for me is the way that we can collaborate and share online, all over the world, bringing to life again the old stories while creating new stories of our own, in words and in images.
-<i>Laura Gibbs, University of Oklahoma, USA</i>
</p>
<hr />
<p>We use “digital humanities” as an umbrella term for a number of different activities that surround technology and humanities scholarship. Under the 
digital humanities rubric, I would include topics like open access to materials, intellectual property rights, tool development, digital libraries, data mining, born-digital preservation, multimedia publication, visualization, GIS, digital reconstruction, study of the impact of technology on numerous fields, technology for teaching and learning, sustainability models, and many others.

<hr />
<p>Where the English department surrenders to the Media Arts department under the conditions that they remain in charge of what storytelling means in the 21st century. 
Hehe. Just kidding.
The merging of Literature, Media Arts and other schools of storytelling and criticism into an emergent network that benefits from history but lacks the downside and fixed ideas of entrenched interests be it in the classroom, the boardroom or copyright office.
This is an attempt to cast a wider net to include social media and the democratization of media production into the literary cannon complete with thoughtful and insightful analysis and scholarly study and reportage. 
Literature department walls become osmotic membranes and connecting tissue between liberal arts scholarship in academia, art, technology and social media content producers. DH is a conceptual location where good ideas, best practices and innovation is encouraged. Transdisciplinarity is the new DH Norm.
DH is a network aggregate university. While individual universities are slow to change, the networked body consisting of DH individuals from many different universities can combine to evolve an educational ecosystem that thrives on change, embraces technology, plurality and open doors, while benefitting from the support of traditional educational organization.

<p>For me, DH is about creating digital toolsets that allow users to undertake new forms of research in the humanities. Just as importantly, it's about making sure we build a deeper understanding of what's changing in the wider world as digital content and interactions become central to our personal and professional endeavours.

<hr />
<p>I view the digital humanities as a collaborative, open, and emerging field of inquiry. A state of mind, a methodology, and theoretical approach to knowledge, I embrace how it forces us to reconceive our practice. In my own work, I embrace curation, as a means of reweaving and reintegrating theory and practice in history. I seek to interpret space, place, and identity in a multi-sensory way. I fail more often than not. But the digital humanities is like jazz in that it is about process, as well as out outcome.
-<i>Mark Tebeau, Cleveland State University, USA</i>
</p>
<hr />
<p>My definition of Digital Humanities is the creative analysis, synthesis and presentation of information (both print and non-print) in digital environment. Digital humanities investigate how digital media affect the disciplines in which they are used. In practice, we are constantly redefining not only the concept of humanities computing but also of computing itself. In this manner, we come to understand how these disciplines when recalibrated for a digital environment contribute to our knowledge of computing; we also come to understand how computing changes the way we acquire knowledge and experience affect.
-<i>Theodoros Chiotis, Oxford University/Greek Language Centre, Greece</i>
</p>

<hr />
<p>Digital Humanities is the application of humanities methodologies and theories to modern technology research.

<hr />
<p>The use of digital technologies to support humanists in their scholarship activities. Moreover humanists are expected to contribute to the perfection of existing digital tools by providing ideas and functional requirements that those tools need to possess.
-<i>Mohamadou Nassourou, University of Würzburg, Germany</i>
</p>
<hr />
<p>The use of technology for supporting long term digital preservation of the human record, and enabling innovative methods for accessing it. The creation of digital infrastructure to support the work of researchers and scholars in the humanities. It also involves the development of computing approaches to humanities disciplines, mutually enriching humanities and computer scientists. In my opinion, Nicholas Negroponte, (MIT Media Lab co-founder), eloquently captures the scope of DH by stating: Computing is not about computers anymore. It is about living.

<p>The Digital Humanities represents an exciting integration of technology and textual culture. There is an increasing need to recognise the culturally productive synthesis represented in the label 'Digital Humanities' and to understand the immense propensity for inclusivity which results from this union. My understanding of the area, though basic and developing, recognises the need for the universal engagement with the positive possibilities for the increased accessibility of information through the Digital Humanities, while also being mindful of the need to preserve the foundations of our humanities.

<hr />
<p>Digital Humanities is the informed and intentional use of digital objects and practices to create and study in the humanities, broadly defined. In that sense, it is a specialization that cuts across disciplinary boundaries to the work of digital humanists in other disciplines. It is also the insistence that the humanities comes to understand the implications of its assumption that only print technologies exist, and it is the insistence that the humanities learns that no technology is invisible, natural, or inevitable, and that someday all humanists will be digital. A few will specialize in print, chirographic or oral-culture humanities.
-<i>Sharon Cogdill, St. Cloud State University, USA</i>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>I think digital humanities, like social media, is an idea that will increasingly become invisible as new methods and platforms move from being widely used to being ubiquitous. For now, digital humanities defines the overlap between humanities research and digital tools. But the humanities are the study of cultural life, and our cultural life will soon be inextricably bound up with digital media.
-<i>Ed Finn, Stanford University, USA</i>
</p>
<hr />
<p>For me, «DH» is an umbrella term for some recent trends in the humanities: amongst others collaborative working and writing, data driven research and visualization. Very often the current discussions on DH are discussions of delimitations and demarcations. One of the main questions is - imho - if DH should be either an integrated part of the humanities or else be some kind of an auxiliary discipline (in the field of History, in German we have the expression «Historische Hilfswissenschaften»).
-<i>Peter Haber, History Department, University of Basel, Switzerland</i>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Digital Humanities involves the effort to consider how our human capabilities and capacities are developing, or being challenged, by and through digital media.  Those scholars and practitioners who locate themselves within digital humanities view themselves as interdisciplinary collaborators who want to work together to enhance opportunities for individuals and groups traditionally marginalized from the centers of power. We therefore see our task as a critical and productive one, pressing back against the tides of efficiency and busyness that are leading people to view themselves merely as earners and consumers rather than as human creators and participants.
-<i>Lynn Schofield Clark, University of Denver, USA</i>
</p>
<hr />
<p>I don't know that defining digital humanities has any useful purpose, though the act of defining marks digital humanities with the attribute of scholarly inquiry. A humanist with an interest in digital things is, I hope, still a humanist, one who defines the self by interest in varieties of human expression. If one's interest is digital things, then one must achieve some form of digital literacy to do useful scholarly things. If one's interest is humanities, one must think about how digital technology reshapes one's interaction with traditional---and new---objects of humanist studies.
-<i>Wesley Raabe, Kent State University, United States</i>

-<i>Tanja Välisalo, University of Jyväskylä, Finland</i>
</p>
<hr />
<p>I let two very different sources define DH for me: 
A field of study, research, teaching, and invention concerned with the intersection of computing and the disciplines of the humanities. (Wikipedia)
and 
The digital humanities are just the humanities of the present moment. (Alex Reid: <a href="http://www.alex-reid.net/" class="external free" title="http://www.alex-reid.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.alex-reid.net/</a>)
I find those two definitions - one very inclusive and dry, and the other thought-provoking but equally inclusive - to be productive and useful. To work in DH is to be curious about the intersection of digital media and humanities research.

<p>The advent of digital technologies is changing and challenging the ways historians practice their craft. The way we collect, present, and store information has changed rapidly in the last twenty years. Digital history is several things: a methodology meant to aid the traditional art and practice of historians, the use of digital tools to gain insight into information that cannot be done with a legal pad and pen, allows historians to disseminate and present their information in new ways, and a means to reach wide audiences through digital technologies. The goal isn’t cliometrics 2.0 or to augment the theory-driven social sciences, but to abide by the historian’s commitment to complexity and nuance while utilizing digital technologies to aid that task.
-<i>Jason Heppler, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, USA</i>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Humanities is humanities, digital or not -- the study of literature, fine arts, history, language, and philosophy.  We don't distinguish digital sociology or digital astronomy, so why digital humanities?  Just because computers are involved doesn't mean the basic nature of the subject area is any different than it has been been traditionally.   Computers allow for doing things with texts and other cultural artifacts that could not be done feasibly without the computational power and storage modern computers provide.   Computers should be considered an extension of the scholar's mind -- very useful tools indeed.

<hr />
<p>The Digital Humanities is both a field with a discernable set of academic lineages, practices, and methodologies, and a vague umbrella term used to describe the application of digital technology to traditional humanistic inquiry. Ultimately, what sets DH apart from many other humanities fields is its methodological commitment to building things as a way of knowing.

-<i>Brad Brace, japan</i>

<hr />
<p>The digital humanities, quite simply, is doing humanities work with digital media. Though much has been made about digital media, like video games, threatening the kind of book learning that humanists do, many of the same critical problems and questions we have been working on for centuries still apply and can be used to read these new media forms. Furthermore, these digital tools can be leveraged to help us do this kind of intellectual labor. So digital humanities includes both doing humanities on digital objects and using digital objects to do humanities. 
-<i>Timothy Welsh, University of Washington, USA</i>
</p>
<hr />
<p>DH is all about freedom.  Humanity is the producing animal (Marx) or the symbol-using animal (Kenneth Burke).   The humanities have always studied what people create in the realm of freedom.  The whole point of putting things in the digital realm is the freedom it gives us, to turn the physical into symbols that we can manipulate as freely as in a video game.   You might not find anyone in the academy more concerned with freedom than digital humanists.    -<i>Alan Bilansky, University of Illinois, USA</i>

<p>When I first applied to this grad program, my understanding of what DH was all about was crystalline in its purity.  Not so today.
</p><p>My idea of DH is that it's sort of like a highway oil slick on a sunny day. When you look at the slick, depending on the angle, you might get a psychedelic kaleidoscope of reflected colours; if you're lucky you might spot your reflection in it; then again, all you might see is darkness.

<p>Digital Humanities is the integration of sophisticated, empirical techniques utilizing tools and technologies typically associated with practical sciences into the study of traditional humanities questions.  It represents a more exploratory and less quantitative approach than social sciences in the use of such tools but it also represents ambitious attempts to model nuanced human wisdom in ways that, like early flying machines, are beautiful, quite impractical and often fail.

<p>DH combines established research methodologies in the Humanities with computational methods and new ways to disseminate digitally both data sets and research findings.  DH is more a community of practice than a specific set of methods and procedures.  Thus, DH encourages ongoing collaboration and its practitioners are committed to making Humanities research extensible (or at least they ought to be).  DH is by nature interdisciplinary and so provides a practical means to integrate research data and methodologies from more than just one humanities discipline.

<p>Digital Humanities is the deliberate, critical application of emerging technology to the study of traditional subjects such as literature, art, philosophy, and language, often (but not always) with a focus on how those traditional fields are now using emerging technology. We are deliberate and critical when we foreground the study of our own digital tools (for example, the forward-thinking digital humanist prefers the open-source tool to the proprietary one). We apply technology because we must participate in digital culture in order to understand it. Full participation in digital culture means contributing to (creating) the cultural economy, not simply observing (consuming).

<p>The digital humanities is a blanket term for many different types of activities.

For all, it is an understanding that while our own minds may have limits, that need not limit what we can do or know.

<p>At its core, the Digital Humanities is the use of digital tools to gather, organize, analyze, and present scholarly research in the humanities. Humanists seek to understand the world and cultures in which people live and have lived through a variety of disciplines including literature, English and other modern languages, philosophy, art, art history, and history. While many of the questions humanists seek to answer have not changed, new technology, like text mining, dynamic visualizations, and spatial analysis, provide humanists ways to ask new questions and view old questions differently.

<p>For me Digital Humanities explores how and whether we can apply technology to our experience of history, heritage and culture. DH questions how technology changes the environment around us, physical and digital, and discusses whether those changes are for the better.

<p>As mentioned above, to me the key aspects of Digital Humanities are the digitisation of materials, and their dissemination to the general public. Work in this field needs to be outward focussed, as much as it is focussed on the furthering of research. The nature of the digital age is that information can be readily shared, that research can take on a far more collaborative nature, and this approach is of importance to all areas of academic study, including the humanities. Presentation, functionality, and ease of use are, in my opinion, as important as the content of digital archives in all disciplines.

<p>I was a computer programmer long before I was a 'professional' humanist; I think in terms of efficient processes and scalable systems.

<p>I think that increasingly there is a little of the digital in almost all research in the humanities. This makes Digital Humanities much harder to define but it makes it more relevant than ever.

<p>DH is anything that combines imagining, planning, building, and creating, using a digital medium, with language, literature, history, philosophy, art, music, etc. Anyone comfortable with a computer and interested in the humanities probably participates in Digital Humanities, whether formally (with support from a fellowship or institution, with a planned and mediated project) or informally (through compiling notes and information in multimedia form). We have as much to learn from the informal processes as the formal.

<p>I work in digital literary studies and archives primarily, so I think about digital humanities in terms of the interactions between texts of various sorts and a wide array of digital environments.

This would include the humanities which take artistic production as their subject, but also the fine arts and performative practices.

<p>I like to define Digital Humanities as a set of new activities for humanists instead of a field of study, because Digital Humanities involve something more than a methodology or an interest on a topic.

This is something that involves you completely.

<p>Digital humanities integrates the acquisition of knowledge through research methods, as well as the expression of intellectual material through emergent technologies and media.

<p>for me Digital Humanities is the filed where the information is delivered in an electronic form to an audience in the humanities field. today the delivery of the information in an electronic form almost has no boundaries. One could easily send a message to one or multiple recipients just from his email account, posting on a blog or simply from his Facebook account (posting a Wall status update). The users around the world are all interconnected together and regardless if one chose to send a message from his yahoo account to an AOL one that is totally possible as now all the separated networks (e.g. AOL, Yahoo) are connected under one umbrella: The Internet. Before, one AOL user was able to send a message just to the members from his network (AOL). Today, the technical developments made possible that everybody could be connected in real time, to anyone else. The information in electronic form can be transmitted not just to those proficient in computing science but also to those interested in modem languages, law, or arts. The capability and easiness of how the digital information can be transmitted/shared/used, not just between and to computing science  related individuals but also to humanities related ones, is the core of the digital humanities field.

<p>I define Digital Humanities as a praxis and also as a field, and in this way it reminds me of Romanticism, also a praxis and a field in my opinion. As a practice, DH involves making and/or thinking about digital objects or entities that participate in or contribute to Humanities disciplines. As a field, it perhaps includes the growing body of electronic literary texts (either e-born or book-born) and archival projects as well as theory and criticism related to digital technologies.

<p>The digital humanities is what digital humanists do.  What digital humanists do depends largely on academic discipline but also on level of technical expertise.  Each discipline, with varying degrees of intensity, has over the years developed a set of favored methods, tools, and interests that, although shared with other disciplines, remains connected to the discipline.  The task of the digital humanities, as a trans-curricular practice, is to bring these practitioners into communication with each other, and to cultivate a discourse that captures the shared praxis of bringing technologies of representation, computation, and communication to bear on the work of interpretation that defines the humanities.

<p>«The digital era is being born from the change of the support itself in the Human Sciences thought, with the transformation of our relationship to textuality. This digital turn happens in the context of a crisis in the Human sciences, first a financial crises, but also an institutional and politic one, even if it is softer in Switzerland. In this context, the «Humanités digitales» – a label diversely interpreted – offer the opportunity to think again our ways of building and transmitting knowledge. The DH are at the same time a practice and a problematic. They include not only the sum total of the digital technologies applied to the Human sciences, but eminently the questioning on the modifications provoked by these technologies, from the point of view of the training et of the knowledge transmission in the Human sciences».

<p>I think digital humanities is an unfortunate neologism, largely because the humanities itself is a problematic term. The biggest problem is that the tent isn't big enough! I have participated in a number of DH events and they are strikingly similar to things like Science Online.
</p><p>With that said, DH is at its best when it embraces the digital not simply as a means to the traditional ends of scholarship, but when it transforms the nature of what humanists do. The digital allows for scholars, librarians, archivists and curators to engage much more directly with each other and the public. Further, it allows them not simply to write for each other, but to build things for everyone.

<p>Digital Humanities, at least for me, is an extension of the root Arts and Humanities disciplines. My experience tells me that computing and technology has led to many new resources and even more answers to research questions. Crucially, it's allowed the researchers I've worked closely with to ask new, previously unimaginable questions. Digital Humanities is a culture, a way of thinking, a new set of methods, and a new set of collaborations.

<p>Good question, to which there is no good answer, but rather just more questions. My own interpretation is quite broad, but there are two ways of seeing DH which interest me - one is generous and encompasses all work combining humanities research and digital tools and methodology etc, and the other would be rather narrower in definition, reflecting on the specific contribution which 'the digital' can make to humanities scholarship and on the 'new scholarship' which develops as a result.

<p>A field of study that looks at the application of digital technology to the research areas of the humanities.  It is not necessarily undertaking that humanities research, but examining the methodology and provision of possibilities for enabling that research or new conceptions of related research. The majority of work in this area, however, gets characterised by those outside the field as IT professionals just doing a bit of programming work for them while uselessly banging on about long-term preservation formats, open data, and not really doing real research.

<hr />
<p>In a world dominated by digital technology, DH is an attempt to let humanists catch up with the latest computing advances, understand them, criticize them, and eventually be able to determine their evolution 'from the inside'. In terms of a research program, though, DH is still largely undefined. We are still in the 'understanding and criticizing' phase, with only few people moving towards a truly 'creative' phase. We're pulled by the latest technologies developed within the other computing fields, hardly pushing back into these fields our own research results, for they are often perceived as too simplistic, or not generic enough.

<p>A decade ago the humanities comprised academic disciplines that were most easily named by reference to the rules governing the American National Endowment for the Humanities. Digital tools have and are breaking down the distinctions among those disciplines as well as between the traditional "humanities" and other fields--the arts, for example. Digital tools are encouraging collaborative and open research. Digital tools are forcing us to rethink our definition of academic. Digital tools are re-defining "scholar." Digital tools may be pointing the way toward new ways of contemplation and contribution. The digital humanities is both a force for and a record of the ongoing changes. <i>William Allen, Arkansas State University, Department of Art History. USA</i>

<p>Digital Humanities is a difficult concept to define; for me DH explores how and whether we can apply technology to our experience of history, heritage and culture. DH questions how technology changes the environment around us, physical and digital, and discusses whether those changes are for the better.

<p>Digital Humanities is the deliberate, critical application of emerging technology to the study of traditional subjects such as literature, art, philosophy, and language, often (but not always) with a focus on how those traditional fields are now using emerging technology. We are deliberate and critical when we foreground the study of our own digital tools (for example, the forward-thinking digital humanist prefers the open-source tool to the proprietary one). We apply technology because we must participate in digital culture in order to understand it. Full participation in digital culture means contributing to (creating) the cultural economy, not simply observing (consuming).

<p>Just as man is, according to Nietzsche, "the animal whose type is not yet determined" ("das noch nicht festgestellte Tier"), digital humanities are those kind of humanities who are as yet undefined. 
We cannot yet gauge the full impact of digital corpora on the future of scholarly research. We can only speculate what the effects will be of the increasingly digital nature of scholarly publishing. We do not yet grasp the consequences of applying computational methods to 'traditional' disciplines such as History, Literature, and Theatre Studies.

<p>Digital humanities, for me, is heavily weighted toward the improvement of resources for researching and understanding literature and history. I see the digital humanities as not only offering tools to offload or streamline traditional research tasks, but as a way to gain new knowledge that was not previously possible by helping learners see new connections and resonances.

We use all kinds of tools to get into 19th Century print culture, and not just tools to assess the 19th Century moment but to also create content that can serve as a critique of our own use of tools, such as Twitter, Moodle, ClassSpot, tech-enhanced teaching facilities.

-<i>Ashton Nichols, Dickinson College, USA</i>

<hr />
<p>My definition has changed a bit from last year.  I continue to regard the digital humanities as a method, or set of methods, as opposed to a full-blown discipline.  I subscribe to Unsworth's claim in "Knowledge Representation" that digital methods are interpretive frameworks to place alongside others, such as new historicism or deconstruction.  But I am more sensitive now to the effects that method has on discipline in the first place, and how the distinction is not entirely stable.  I also believe that some curricular space should be devoted to media fluency, just as we devote time to writing.

We will be working with some of the more advanced aspects of XML, XSLT, XHTML and CSS.

<p>I define humanities computing as the field of study that helps to provide insight into the human condition through digital technologies.  The methods and techniques used in the digital humanities can be varied: algorithms for emergent art, the application of procedural rhetorics to explore sociocultural issues, or the design and analysis of procedures to make computing technologies more human-friendly.  Research methods related to the digital humanities can be hermeneutic (e.g., what are the hidden cultural and social layers within technological practice, and what do they tell us about particular discourse communities?), ontological (e.g., how do I project my own beliefs, desires, and values onto a personal avatar?), or purely practical (e.g., how can I digitize this text to make it available and searchable to those audiences who do not have the means or ability to access a physical copy?) Humanities computing and the digital humanities are of vital importance as they keep technological systems human-centered, leaving room for creativity, exploration, and playfulness.  The famous interdisciplinary German thinker G. W. Leibniz pursued the dream of the Universal Computer as a means for freeing up the human mind for more creative and enjoyable pursuits; although information overload and the increased workload of distributed industries have made this goal quite challenging, I feel that the field of digital humanities does more to advance this philosophy of creative playfulness and exploration perhaps more than any other area of scholarly study.

<p>For me, the digital humanities is not a discipline per se, but a set of beliefs, theories, practices, methods, and artifacts associated with the use of digital technologies to support, extend, and transform traditional humanistic fields.  It cross-cuts the traditional humanities.  I follow Erwin Panofsky's definition of the humanities as those disciplines concerned with interpreting the "records left by man."  (Sexism not intended.)  Among the specific items in the assemblage of artifacts and ideas that currently characterize the field are (1) the use XML in a variety of forms, including TEI and serial RDF, to encode texts and data, and (2) the use of mathematical graph theory as a unifying language for describing texts, minds, and societies, and other organis(m|ation)s.

<p>Humanist Computing is the application of computational methods and associated tools to address specific humanities research problems. Distinct from general computing approaches, Humanities Computing is embedded within the research concerns of the disciplines and sub-fields that make up the humanities. The methods employed in the field may be used to uncover new knowledge about corpora or to visualise research data in such a way as to uncover additional insights and meaning. Succinctly Humanities Computing is about structuring, analysing and communicating humanistic knowledge in a critical and authorial way using computing technology.

<p>Digital Humanities, from my perspective as an educator, has to do with helping students use the skills they have (and are learning) as writers and critical thinkers to compose and critique multi-media works in both academia and their daily lives.

<p>'Digital' Humanities is a misnomer: there nothing to essentially distinguish it from the disciplines of Arts and Letters as practised for centuries. Just as scientists who utilise grid-computing are not 'digital scientists' but still 'scientists', and fiction authors who publish in hypertext are not 'digital novelists', those working in Arts and Letters who use and generate digital materials and digital tools remain 'humanists'.

<p>Applying spatial information technologies in the field of archaeology
is my main subject. But as archaeological data are 'weak', i.e. might
have multiple meanings in different contexts, I'm trying to follow up
developments in Digital Humanities as a whole. Especially as it is not
an established field in German scholarship.

<p>For those us invested in literary studies and bibliophilism, digital humanities may seem like a contradictory and terrifying set of terms. Yet, the divide between the humanities and digital technologies seems to be increasingly blurred, thus rendering “digital humanities” a complementary set of terms rather than a contradiction. Computing within the humanities is to utilize current computer technologies in the pursuit of literary studies. Digital humanities is the conjoining of different areas of disciplines in order to achieve a richer and more collaborative workspace; digital humanities signals the move towards interdisciplinary approaches within academia and the larger culture around us. E-pedagogy, social media classrooms, digital storytelling, blogs, etc. -- these are merely some examples in the current trend towards more interactive, collaborative, and interdisciplinary ways of learning that allows for a blurring of boundaries. Paving the way for dialogues to occur across different disciplines, digital humanities enables a kind of social utopia in which communication happens beyond the classroom, and even on a global scale. If the humanities concerns itself with the human condition and our place within this world (to put it broadly), it is imperative that humanists address the impact of digital technology on their subjects of inquiries. As English professor Cathy Davidson claimed in a 2009 Modern Language Association panel, this is not the age of digital technology: this is the age of humanists, and it is our tasks to forge and claim our positions as important thinkers and players within today’s “digital age.”

<p>Digital Humanities: the creation and preservation of extensible digital archives to document, and
tools to interact with, material culture.- <i>Robert Whalen, Northern Michigan University</i>
</p>
<hr />
<p>If you ask to an Italian, a Finnish or an American what HC is, would you get the same kind of answer? So my first answer
is to start questioning the nature of your question. I think we need to start to apply the principles
of ethnographic research to our field. Considering, for example, the existence of strong cultural differences. The universal
language of the digital machine gave us the wrong impression that we all share the same values, methodologies, and approaches to the study of cultural objects. It is not so, and in fact I think there is a huge potential cultural danger in our current obsession with standardization. So my second answer would be that humanities computing is a semiotic oxymoron (pessimistic answer), but also a cultural challenge (optimistic option). Sometimes I ask myself: why HC did not do to humanities what cultural studies did to sociology, anthropology, or philosophy? Think of the profound impact that CS had on their intellectual agendas. My answer is that HC lacked an effective and self-confident cultural vision. This happened, in my opinion, beacause HC until now has been mainly focused on the document culture, and consequently has adopted an approach largely dependent on conservative (or if you prefer 'conservation') practices. The 'paradigm of conservation' is largely dominant in the international scenario, led by historically monolingual and monocultural institutions like TEI, which basically tells the community not just how to encode a text, but what a text is. It has been said by other colleagues that HC is the application of computational methods to humanities research and teaching. This definition is correct, but I think that future of HC would be not just to use and apply formal methods, but to challenge existing discourses, cultures and disciplines. So perhaps the issue would be not how much computing we need for getting the answers, but how much the computer science needs us to ask the right questions.- <i>Domenico Fiormonte, Università Roma Tre</i>

<p>For me, Humanities Computing means the transformation of creative and informative communication (for all individuals, not just academics, students and other experts) via an ever- and expanding array of information and communication technologies, an amplification of the individual's power to research, to write, to communicate, to publish and to participate in, and create new spaces in, the public sphere. Just as I feel that the Humanities enrich everyone's life, humanities transformed by ICTs enrich everyone's life. - <i>Lesley Mary Smith, George Mason University</i>

<p>The best way I've found to describe what Digital Humanities is, in first place to myself, is using a quote from Thomas Pynchon's Crying of Lot 49: "You know what a miracle is ... another world's intrusion into this one" - <i>Federico Meschini, De Montfort University</i>
</p>
<hr />
<p>I broadly define Humanities Computing/Digital Humanities as a field in which scholars within the humanities use or study computers or a digital environment (e.g. the WWW, video games, etc.) in their research.  I consider myself to be a digital humanities researcher because I am studying digital short fiction and its communities in my thesis, but also because I sometimes use social science methods and computing tools (online questionnaires, quantitative/qualitative analysis, etc.), which reflects the interdisciplinary nature of humanities computing.  Although I am currently completing a Ph.D. in English, my M.A. in Humanities Computing and Comparative Literature from the University of Alberta has helped me to approach my research from a more interdisciplinary perspective-- something that I see as being an integral part of humanities computing/digital humanities.

<p>Digital humanities studies the intersection and mutual influence of humanities ideas and digital methods, with the goal of understanding how the use of digital technologies and approaches alters the practice and theory of humanities scholarship. In this sense it is concerned with studying the emergence of scholarly disciplines and communicative practices at a time when those are in flux, under the influence of rapid technological, institutional and cultural change. As a way of identifying digital interests and efforts within traditional humanities fields, the term “digital humanities” also identifies, in a general way, any kind of critical engagement with digital tools and methods in a humanities context. This includes the creation of digital editions and digital text or image collections, and the creation and use of digital tools for the investigation and analysis of humanities research materials.

<p>I often say that humanities computing involves three distinct research areas. First, some researchers apply computing to research questions in the humanities. These might be questions they've always pursued but can now pursue faster or at a larger scale, or they may be questions that could not be addressed satisfactorily at all without computers. Second, some researchers take computing as an object of study using humanities methods. Examples include cyberculture and posthumanism. Third, some researchers take a generative approach, creating new online materials or tools for subsequent study and use. Most of my own work is in this third area.

<p>Digital Humanities to me encompasses any of a multitude of approaches to the arts and humanities that address and embrace the empowering societal shifts afforded by technology.  Digital Humanities is about open communication, collaboration and expression.  It mirrors my own artistic process of A/R/Tograpy, in that DH incorporates art, research and technology.  It is about discovery and sharing as much as it is about archival and data visualization.  Above all, Digital Humanities is about shedding light on the human experience and ultimately our own interconnectedness.
