						<p>Every year, we ask new Day of DH participants to offer their own definition of how they define the digital humanities.</p>
<p>Below is a list of responses for 2012. If you&#8217;re interesting is seeing how things have changed, <a href="http://tapor.ualberta.ca/taporwiki/index.php/How_do_you_define_Humanities_Computing_/_Digital_Humanities%3F">the responses for Day of DH 2009, 2010, and 2011 are available</a>.</p>

						<hr/><h3>How do you define digital humanities?</h3><p>The thoughtful use of computing in humanistic inquiry and the thinking through of computing from the perspective of the traditions of the humanities.<br/>&mdash;<em>Geoffrey Rockwell</em></p><p>Digital humanities is the use of advanced digital technologies (and the extended social and discursive worlds these technologies make possible) to investigate questions in the humanities.<br/>&mdash;<em>Micki McGee</em></p><p>Researchers working with digital materials, tools, or methods in the humanities; researchers creating new digital materials, tools, or methods in the humanities; researchers studying computing using humanities methods.<br/>&mdash;<em>Stan Ruecker</em></p><p>All the ways that the humanities and digital technologies intersect.<br/>&mdash;<em>Rebecca Davis</em></p><p>Digital Humanities is the use of digital technologies to generate and answer new questions relevant to humanities scholar and to share and transform scholarship and its modes of creation/dissemination.<br/>&mdash;<em>Michael Widner</em></p><p>"A diverse and still emerging field that includes the practice of humanities research in and through information technology. It also includes the development of digital educational/research/teaching/archival/publishing resources for the specific use and study of the humanities and interconnected disciplines. The digital humanities is also concerned with an  exploration of how humanities may evolve through their engagement with technology.<br/>&mdash;<em>Ernesto Priego</em></p><p>Digital scholarship in the humanities<br/>&mdash;<em>Kiyonori Nagasaki</em></p><p>Digital Humanities as a whole is something I am extremely reluctant to define, because any definition will inevitably cause controversy. However, I have not heard any dispute over my work being part of digital humanities, and that work involves computationally analyzing data sets from the field of Slavic linguistics, and de-siloing scholarship in that same field through a collaboratively authored academic wiki.<br/>&mdash;<em>Quinn Dombrowski</em></p><p>http://mith.umd.edu/the-questions-of-digital-humanities<br/>&mdash;<em>Neil Fraistat</em></p><p>The building and use of digital tools for studying the humanities.<br/>&mdash;<em>David N. Wright</em></p><p>The humanities in and for a digital age<br/>&mdash;<em>Laurie N. Taylor</em></p><p>Previously, I defined DH as an umbrella term for something like the use of technology to study human cultures and the study of the effects of digital technology on human cultures. Today, I would add that DH has (or should have) a self-conscious reflection on the technical aspects of these endeavours, whether that means acquiring and making use of the programming skills to produce new tools for digital study of human culture, examining the methodological problems of using these tools, or theorising the way their underlying technologies affect human society and the material objects of human culture. That said, I am worried that the theorising of the Digital Humanities, the development of infrastructure to support the Digital Humanities, and the opportunity of exploiting the big data sphere of the internet are collectively having the effect of marginalising the study of traditional objects of study in the Humanities, particularly those of the more distant past.<br/>&mdash;<em>Scott Kleinman</em></p><p>The digital humanities is about creating people. Creating people who intersect with and apply the tools and methods of computer science using the principles, values, and techniques of the humanities.<br/>&mdash;<em>Craig Bellamy</em></p><p>Making stuff, and using it to collaborate and connect with the public.<br/>&mdash;<em>Roger Whitson</em></p><p>A community of practice using and critiquing digital tools to further humanities study.<br/>&mdash;<em>Amanda French</em></p><p>Digital Humanities (DH) is an umbrella term for a variety of practices, methodologies, and forms of scholarship unified by a mutual interest in the humanities and the digital. The Digital Humanities, ever plural, at once denote a social community, a tactical term, a mode of research, and an object of research.<br/>&mdash;<em>dana solomon</em></p><p>If you think you are doing it, then you probably are, but the UCLDH definition is: the application of computational methods to humanities research or to cultural heritage; or of humanities research methods to digital phenomena.<br/>&mdash;<em>Claire Warwick</em></p><p>At its simplest, DH is the utilization of computers and computational tools for the exploration, analysis, and production of humanistic knowledge.<br/>&mdash;<em>Jennifer Guiliano</em></p><p>You don't.<br/>&mdash;<em>erochest</em></p><p>The intersection between Arts &amp; Humanities disciplines and technology. A space where new tools are used and developed, and where new ways of looking at and preforming researching become possible. Most of all, it is fun. Fun because it is challenging, each day, every day.<br/>&mdash;<em>David Beavan</em></p><p>As I siad on my blog: Digital Humanities is the discipline born from the intersection between humanities scholarship and computational technologies. 
It aims at investigating how digital methodologies can be used to enhance research in disciplines such a History, Literature, Languages, Art History, Music, Cultural Studies and many others. 
Digital Humanities holds a very strong practical component as it includes the concrete creation of digital resources for the study of specific disciplines.<br/>&mdash;<em>Elena Pierazzo</em></p><p>Digital Humanities mean, to me, more now than it did back in 2009 when I first did the Day of DH. DH offers a set of tools to pose humanistic inquiry, but it doesn't necessarily offer definitive answers to those questions. Instead it celebrates and records a process of intellectual pursuit that is then distributed and disseminated to the Humanities community and abroad. Engaging in Digital Humanities is also an ethos: collaboration, building knowledge, sharing projects, screwing around. I apply this to my scholarship as well as my teaching. If my work is better, more complex, because of Digital Humanities, so too will my students' work benefit from the tools, state of mind, and ethos.<br/>&mdash;<em>Katherine D. Harris</em></p><p>The practice of combining emerging digital tools and traditional humanistic study to create new, interactive, integrative, and public ways of disseminating research and discovery.<br/>&mdash;<em>Lee Skallerup Bessette</em></p><p>As the studying and building of digital research tools for humanities scholarship. For me, this entails trying to offer informed guidance to the historians who want to use digital research tools (but can't build them) and the developers who can build these digital research tools (but won't be using them).<br/>&mdash;<em>James Baker</em></p><p>DH allows, maybe even forces, me to think differently about teaching. It's a community of learners and thinkers who look at tools as ways to make new tools and knowledge.<br/>&mdash;<em>Ian Thomas</em></p><p>Digital Humanities is the critical study of how the technologies and techniques associated with the digital medium intersect with and alter humanities scholarship and scholarly communication.<br/>&mdash;<em>Julia Flanders</em></p><p>Oftener and oftener as one's self-identification with a perceived inflection of study and regard for the world that involves humanities scholarship in digital environments.<br/>&mdash;<em>Tanya Clement</em></p><p>This is my first time participating in the event.  I think of digital humanities as the intersection of computing and the arts.<br/>&mdash;<em>Christian Price</em></p><p>Digital Humanities are the first step towards Future Humanities.<br/>&mdash;<em>Davor</em></p><p>I view the Digital Humanities as a constantly changing field, which escapes easy definition - this is has benefits but also presents challenges! Standard definitions talk about the application of information technology to humanities teaching and research - whether that be to develop better ways of doing things or to create new questions and paradigms - but I think that the field also has a key role in articulating how technology is changing scholarship.<br/>&mdash;<em>Paul Spence</em></p><p>Digital Humanities is the combination of using digital techniques to better understand and present our understanding of the Humanities. It is about the dissemination of our work, the sharing of knowledge and collaborating to give the best possible chance to a project. Digital Humanities is about the Community, about learning, constantly evolving and being open to new ways of thinking about old questions. It is not, as a friend asked, about building digital humans.<br/>&mdash;<em>Natasha Martin</em></p><p>I would define Digital Humanities as a term used to identify persons, practices, ideologies, etc., that conform to institutional and scholarly values as determined by individual and institutional norms.  But I would distinguish the definition of DH from doing digital humanities work (theoretical, practical, critical), which means something much more. Doing digital humanities means challenging the institutionalization of humanistic inquiry; in fact, it means responding to the crippling institutionalization of emotive responses to humanistic practices within the public sphere of all “knowledge workers.”  To do this means that we must build tools, technologies, methodologies, and theories that represent this disruptive force, but we must also put what we build into practice.  It is not longer enough to present (or represent) an idea, a tool; we must do the work of the community and we must engage the community in developing the ways in which we make our (our as in humanity) work accessible (this means disability studies needs to become a stronger focus of our scholarship and our practices).  We must, as Alan Liu argued practice being the service community that we have always wanted to become.<br/>&mdash;<em>Shawn W. Moore</em></p><p>I think I said last year that I dislike that question, and that remains the case. Its boundaries are continually shifting and elude satisfactory definition. Even something as simple as "Using computers for teaching and research in the Humanities" can have caveats. I recognise why a definition of DH might be desirable, but still: I dislike the question.<br/>&mdash;<em>Justin Tonra</em></p><p>Qualitative queries, quantified.<br/>&mdash;<em>Michael Ullyot</em></p><p>The connections made between humans, text, and images that cannot be made in a strictly analog network.<br/>&mdash;<em>Matthew Butler</em></p><p>The use of digital tools, media and corpora in the humanities, thus changing both the objects and practices in the Humanities.<br/>&mdash;<em>Lebarbé Thomas</em></p><p>The undertaking of humanities using digital tools and techniques. (But I've read much better answers previous years.)<br/>&mdash;<em>James Cummings</em></p><p>sudo riverrun past eve<br/>&mdash;<em>Aurélien Berra</em></p><p>When quantification meets representation.<br/>&mdash;<em>Ben Miller</em></p><p>The place where technology meets traditional study.<br/>&mdash;<em>Sharon Taylor</em></p><p>In DH, scholars either try to solve to old problems with new means, in an verifiable way by applying algorithms to given data, or they try to find new questions that couldn't have been asked before with traditional means, e.g. checking a theory against huge amounts of data. DH also implies new presentation of data, methods, and results.<br/>&mdash;<em>Torsten Schaßan</em></p><p>Digital Humanities captures the passion for the traditional craft and emboldens it to ask new questions of old data in exciting, compelling and innovative ways.<br/>&mdash;<em>Shawn Day</em></p><p>Researching the Humanities through digital perspectives, researching digital technologies from the perspective of the Humanities<br/>&mdash;<em>Francesca Benatti</em></p><p>Digital Humanities is to me the use and abuse of technology to potential improve research within the field of humanities. It stretches from a simple blog, to complex corpus tools, to whatever the next person can think of.<br/>&mdash;<em>Chris Martin</em></p><p>Digital Humanities is a young field within the Humanities and Technologies, yet not clearly defined. The Digital Humanities take advantage of applying mathematical methods for the analysis of cultural phenomena.<br/>&mdash;<em>Markus Schnoepf</em></p><p>For me, digital humanities is thinking through making, as well as writing.   More specifically, it’s currently about thinking critically about the impact of digitality on scholarly practice in addition to applying digital techniques to the concerns of the humanities.<br/>&mdash;<em>Mia</em></p><p>http://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitalna_humanistika
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_humanities<br/>&mdash;<em>Miran Hladnik</em></p><p>Humanities or liberal arts which cannot be formed without computers. I use "Jimbun Jouhougaku 人文情報学" in Japanese (literal translation: Humanities Informatics) as a Humanities-like discipline based on the methodology of Informatics, which can be formed without computers.<br/>&mdash;<em>Shigeki Moro</em></p><p>It is simple. Human use digital signal, namely syllables, more precisely logical syllables for communication. This is the only difference between human and non-human animals, who communicate by exchanging analog or physical signals modulated by their emotion.<br/>&mdash;<em>Kumon Kimiaki TOKUMARU</em></p><p>A community of practice involving anyone who engages with humanities subject areas through critical, reflexive and collaborative development and use of digital technologies.<br/>&mdash;<em>Kathryn E. Piquette</em></p><p>As a social construct.<br/>&mdash;<em>louburnard</em></p><p>Digital Humanities is more than a methodology.<br/>&mdash;<em>James O'Sullivan</em></p><p>The use of digital methods, tools, resources,and/or models to research, study, and/or mediate what it means to be human.  If it must be measured, I prefer to do so by degrees rather than by delineations.<br/>&mdash;<em>Lisa Rhody</em></p><p>Digital Humanities is a field overseeing the work that needs to be done using digital media in order to preserve and interpret the human record.<br/>&mdash;<em>Laura Mandell</em></p><p>A broad array of practices that seek to understand if/how digital technologies allow us to ask new questions of or think in new ways about our objects of study.<br/>&mdash;<em>Jacqueline Wernimont</em></p><p>Digital Humanities, as a discipline, is a subset of the Humanities. It implies that one engages with digital media--whether they are tools or topics of enquiry--while doing Humanities work.<br/>&mdash;<em>Kirstyn Leuner</em></p><p>"Digital humanities" is a gathering term for scholars who embrace technology as a means to explore humanities material as data.<br/>&mdash;<em>Robin Davis</em></p><p>What it really comes down to is what are people doing to contribute to an understanding of the digital age or what are they doing to expand the practices and work of humanities fields using current technology. A person is not a Digital Humanist by mistake. They are not a Digital Humanist simply because they use a computer to do their work nor are they a Digital Humanist simply by virtue of working in a humanities field and being able to program. What is the methodological framework for their work? For example, using JuXta for collation on a new edition of a novel for the sake of efficiency does not make that edition a DH project, but writing about how the use of JuXta changes the way that we create scholarly editions of literature would fall into the DH field. Essentially, whether or not a person is trying to engage with DH, whether in theory or in practice, determines whether or not they are a Digital Humanist.<br/>&mdash;<em>tesshab</em></p><p>It's the sum of a lot of separate activities involving doing humanities research and using computers at more or less the same time, and with at least an intermittent element of methodological reflection.<br/>&mdash;<em>John Lavagnino</em></p><p>I think of digital humanities as an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of digital work in the humanities: development of multimedia pedagogies and scholarship, designing &amp; building tools, human computer interaction, designing &amp; building archives, etc. DH is interdisciplinary; by necessity it breaks down boundaries between disciplines at the local (e.g., English and history) and global (e.g., humanities and computer sciences) levels.<br/>&mdash;<em>Kathie Gossett</em></p><p>Through the things I make<br/>&mdash;<em>Trevor Muñoz</em></p><p>The study of the effects of enabling computational technologies upon the social organisational of civilisation.<br/>&mdash;<em>Jonathon Hutchinson</em></p><p>Taking people to bits.<br/>&mdash;<em>Graeme Earl</em></p><p>Intersectional activities between the humanities and informatics commonly convergent on ever evolving computational technologies<br/>&mdash;<em>Masahiro Shimoda</em></p><p>Building and/or using advanced digital technologies and methodologies to conduct research in the humanities<br/>&mdash;<em>Erin Snyder</em></p><p>Digital humanities is a scholarly enterprise which encompasses a field of study, a set of tools, a methodological approach, and a global community, among other things. Digital humanists examine the objects of humanistic study – literature, history, art, language and so forth – using digital tools to carry out the kind of analysis that would be very difficult or impossible to do without the use of technology. Where the value of digital humanities lies, however, is not in the powerful capabilities of the digital tools themselves – as impressive as these may be – but rather in the way that the analyses and visualizations produced by the technology are combined with the skills of critical interpretation, nuanced close analysis, and attentiveness to ambiguity which are born out of a deep grounding in so-called conventional humanities study.<br/>&mdash;<em>Anouk Lang</em></p><p>I guess I define DH as twofold : Using technology to do Humanities Research and doing Humanities research about Technology. Plus a commitment to the openness of knowledge. Plus a commitment to build new scholarly objects.<br/>&mdash;<em>Enrico Natale</em></p><p>Making use of the Information Technologies for Humanities research.<br/>&mdash;<em>Georg Vogeler</em></p><p>The ineffably sublime.<br/>&mdash;<em>Stéfan Sinclair</em></p><p>DH is multiple. DH is part humanities computing which designs, develops, and/or utilizes computing technologies for research and analysis. DH is also a community interested in collaborative projects and sharing knowledge across disciplines. Still, DH goes beyond the instrumentality of technologies, by critically engaging with questions of knowledge formation, dissemination, and preservation.<br/>&mdash;<em>Joan Shaffer</em></p><p>By press.<br/>&mdash;<em>Lasse Jalonen</em></p><p>The development, exploration, and evaluation of computer-based technologies and resources for enabling the pursuit of research questions in the humanities.<br/>&mdash;<em>Susan Brown</em></p><p>I have come to think about the digital humanities as an umbrella term for a few different things. These include the development of tools and software for research, teaching, and scholarship. In this case every part of the development process and use of these tools is potentially DH scholarship. I would also include the use of any digital tools and software for interpretation and analysis on humanities research questions. Beyond this I would include any work that involves challenging the traditional roles of scholarship and scholarly communication. For example, using blogs to communicate with broader audiences. Lastly, I would suggest that new media studies, that is studies of born digital objects is inherently a subset of work in the digital humanities. In short, any situation in which the idea of the digital touches or engages with work in the humanities.<br/>&mdash;<em>Trevor Owens</em></p><p>Humanities<br/>&mdash;<em>Martin Holmes</em></p><p>I define Digital Humanities as that which lies on the continuum that began in orality, and moved through literate or print-based humanities, resulting in contemporary humanistic endeavors. In other words, I don't see it as a break with all that has come before. That said, however, epistemological shifts characterize the digital humanities, distinguishing them from earlier iterations.<br/>&mdash;<em>Virginia Kuhn</em></p><p>It's what 'we' do.<br/>&mdash;<em>Simon Mahony</em></p><p>The process of acknowledging, interpreting and engaging with the digital in relation to humanities sources and approaches.<br/>&mdash;<em>Claire Lynch</em></p><p>A willingness to engage in new modes of exploring humanities problems using interdisciplinary approaches that may go beyond the comfort level of traditional scholars in your core discipline but that seek truth and understanding with all the rigours of academic research.<br/>&mdash;<em>Adam Crymble</em></p><p>In the last 10 years I would have said something along these lines: As an experienced manager and ICT consultant my approach towards DH is practical. For me DH is about interconnecting researchers (and their collections), software developers and infrastructure providers. As a researcher my aim is different. Then DH is about bringing central questions about the nature of the humanities to light.

But now I believe Digital Humanities is coming of age. And in my opinion Digital Humanities has become an intrinsic part of the Humanities. Therefore Digital Humanities is the same as the Humanities.<br/>&mdash;<em>Douwe Zeldenrust</em></p><p>To my mind, Digital Humanities is a two-pronged discipline:
1. Digital Humanists study the ways in which new technologies and new media impact on traditional humanities disciplines, on human interaction, society, and communication.
2. Digital Humanists develop tools and resources for humanities students and scholars to further studies in the humanities and the social sciences, but also to allow for new research questions as new data and tools to examine this data become available.<br/>&mdash;<em>Christine McWebb</em></p><p>A fluid term to describe a variety of practices applying and theorizing the intersection of technology and humanities questions.<br/>&mdash;<em>Amy Earhart</em></p><p>DHers want to find the parameters of meaning that building (and failing) can disclose.<br/>&mdash;<em>Kathi Inman Berens</em></p><p>The Digital Humanities is an inclusive, open community, whose participants include students, researchers, teachers, and other people interested in participating in discussions of issues related to the learning, teaching, social, political, technical, economic implications of the Web. DH is building, collaborating, learning, sharing.<br/>&mdash;<em>Elizabeth Cornell</em></p><p>'Digital Humanities' is a term describing fields of study and endeavor where the innovative use of new technologies are foregrounded to facilitate the evolution and expansion of 'traditional' humanities knowledge and activities.<br/>&mdash;<em>Michael J. Maguire</em></p><p>I find this question very hard, as I am just now trying to find out what Digital Humanities is -- this is my first time participating in the event --, and as I have the feeling there is not a unique and complete definition for it. But Digital Humanities has definetly something to do with engaging humanities through use of digital techologies.<br/>&mdash;<em>Kollontai</em></p><p>The Digital now threads through every aspect of the Humanities.<br/>&mdash;<em>James G.R. Cronin</em></p><p>As a PhD student working in Archaeological Computing, researching the impact of technology on the Cultural Heritage sector, but based within the Electronics and Computer Science department of my university, I see the Digital Humanities as a useful definition of the place of my research within an academic context.  I see the Digital Humanities also as a support network for academics and professionals with a digital component to their work.<br/>&mdash;<em>Nicole Beale</em></p><p>Digital Humanities is a pedagogical and scholarly approach that is both complemented by—and can exist separately from—appropriate technological tools. Tools can help scholars and practitioners consider both broad swaths of creative endeavor—whether textual, visual, acoustic, or otherwise immersive—and layers of nested and interconnected meanings to develop new ways to engage with an emerging ecology of knowledge.<br/>&mdash;<em>Pavel Cenkl</em></p><p>The application of digital technology to humanities research and teaching.<br/>&mdash;<em>Dot Porter</em></p><p>Each year that I've been asked this question, it's become harder and harder to answer. My current answer, I think, is that Digital Humanities IS the humanities as it is practiced, modeled, and theorized today.<br/>&mdash;<em>Lauren Klein</em></p><p>What sits at the intersection of computational method and the traditional pursuits of the humanities.<br/>&mdash;<em>Ray Siemens</em></p><p>Cross-disciplinary projects coined by a new generation of humanists as model users, who are asking and creating novel applications and solutions from and with more geeky and technical disciplines, with excellent innovative outcomes, connecting contemporary and fashionable technology with scientific research.<br/>&mdash;<em>Mona Hess</em></p><p>The phrase seems to say it for itself—something related to the humanities going digital. That means anything within the realm of the humanities—language, history, philosophy, literature, and the arts—is fair game. In its most basic form, it is still transferring such topics into a digital medium, but more so for the purpose of uncovering or gaining some new information or perspective on the subject being presented. It could come in the form of visually condensing text in order to both give a general idea of the contents and to provide a quicker delivery of knowledge, or by laying out information in some other visual manner so that patterns can be used to quickly pick up on details that provide certain insight into the subject matter.<br/>&mdash;<em>Iris</em></p><p>DH is what critical theory is or was--an opportunity to ask new questions, try new methods, engage in new conversations.<br/>&mdash;<em>ssenier</em></p><p>The practice of undertaking digitally informed research and teaching in fields covered by the traditional humanities disciplines.<br/>&mdash;<em>Kerry Kilner</em></p><p>The convergence between Humanities (human and social sciences) and Digital Technologies, either as new methodological and epistemological approaches or as the  object of investigations of social, cultural and political concerns.<br/>&mdash;<em>Henrique Parra</em></p><p>With some reluctance, as many have said!

That's the bare bones of it. But really, in practice (or in Praxis, in my case, as in the Praxis Program at UVa - get it?), DH is a wild, carefree romp through the worlds of coding, design, project management, data analysis, and much more, in order to rethink and reappropriate traditional methodologies of humanities scholarship and research.<br/>&mdash;<em>Brooke Lockwood Lestock</em></p><p>While I endorse all the work done under the rubric of Digital Humanities, I am actually not a fan of the term. I feel that the term is used to define a political move within academia that is focused on the privileging of certain technologies and technological approaches over the greater epistemological questions that define the humanities and its constituent disciplines. As someone who has to work with people who may be wary of digital technology in their teaching, research, and publishing practice, I find that insinuating that "digital humanities" is in some way essentially different from general humanities alienates the unfamiliar and more deeply entrenches the already conservative. I believe that an approach that considers the incorporation of these technologies as part of a continuum in the ongoing impact of technology on academic work that predates the digital and not as a political paradigmatic shift better reminds us that scholarship is centrally focused on the answering of questions about the unknown with whatever tools are at our disposal. The digital shouldn't really matter in the name and we should think about incorporating this approach to scholarship across all work and not a subset of research.

Doing research in the humanities often boils down to finding a pattern--in a single text or across several texts--and then providing an interpretation of that pattern. In digital humanities, computation is used to assist in pattern recognition, pulling out patterns that would be difficult for humans to find unassisted. Interpretation of that pattern, however, remains the most important part of the process.<br/>&mdash;<em>Brian Croxall</em></p><p>Using computers to analyse humanities materials and subjects, or the critical contemplation of using digital technologies for such purposes.

Gold</em></p><p>Digital Humanities is the study of various humanities through the use of computational techniques. The idea is to gather new information that traditional study methods would not easily pinpoint. This new approach can also speed up the process of information retrieval, acting as a supplement to traditional studies and enhancing our overall understanding of the humanities.<br/>&mdash;<em>Ryan E Simmons</em></p><p>The “digital humanities” is an umbrella term that describes how humanities scholars are using digital tools to inform, approach and present their research and teaching.<br/>&mdash;<em>Adeline Koh</em></p><p>Very broadly--any application of the humanities that involves digital tools and/or approaches.<br/>&mdash;<em>Eric Johnson</em></p><p>Bringing digital tools, objects and techniques to bear on traditional humanities scholarship.<br/>&mdash;<em>Elijah Meeks</em></p><p>In a recent article on Inside Higher Ed., Steve Kolowich defines “digital humanities” as “a branch of scholarship that takes the computational rigor that has long undergirded the sciences and applies it to the study of history, language, art and culture.”  To this (and other definitions of digital humanities), I would add that the digital humanities must also consider the interface between digital and analog culture, between the pixels of our computer screens and the printed text of bound books.  What we do online has little meaning if it isn’t linked (literally or figuratively) to embodied practice.  What we are online only exists insofar as it is connected to what we are in the flesh.<br/>&mdash;<em>Jesse Stommel</em></p><p>Digital Humanities, as I have understood it this semester, is the idea or goal in the process of creating something new. I would define Digital Humanities as the idea of integrating and analyzing technical/computational material and create activities with humanistic studies. Basically, it's understanding the material deeper. One activity we did for example this semester was reading the stories of Sherlock Holmes. To understand the story better, with DH we used a tool called the Voyant website. On there, we were able to explore more of the stories depth such as discovering which words are used more than others, also creating charts and graphs and etc.. We were also fortunate to watch the TV series "Sherlock" to understand the story and actual characters a bit more. Another activity was when reading the novel "Ms. Dalloway," which consists of text on paper, with D; we did a mapping project of each of the character's main movements and sightseeing. It made it seem as if we could actually see where they went every day in real life using Google earth. Basically, I would say digital humanities is the process of going further within the research to find that hidden quality that you couldn't see on the surface and create something new with it.<br/>&mdash;<em>Lexie</em></p><p>Humanities + Digital = some new methods, ways of making, ways of seeing, and research questions<br/>&mdash;<em>Jim Ridolfo</em></p><p>Digital Humanities are conceived as a modern approach to explore and develop innovative information technologies to facilitate new research findings in the humanities.

"Digital humanities research takes place at the intersection of digital technologies and humanities.

This is far from simple, however. Digital technologies change the way we do work. They change the way we compose and revise even when we are writing for print publication. They also afford us new ways to distribute and publish our work and how we can analyze and manipulate information. More radically, however, digital technologies change the way we organize and perceive the world which leads us to ask new questions and adopt new ideologies.
